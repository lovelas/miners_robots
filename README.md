#ABOUT
This is a mod that provides simple,programmable,robots.  
They have a (hopefully) extremely simple programming language.  
You have 64 spaces of "command memory" on the robot,each space containing 1 command.  
Most importantly,robots cannot pass through anything except pure air.  
If the air actually is a node(such as water),the robot will not pass though.
If you detect water(you mine a block sucessfully yet you cannot move),place and then mine a block that is very quick to mine.
Failing that,it's either not water,or you have to try again.
